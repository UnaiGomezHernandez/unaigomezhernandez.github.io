My name is Unai Gómez-Hernández, and I am an academic working on politics, international relations, and European studies.
My main research focus is the influence that radical right populist parties have on the EU’s external action towards China in the European Parliament.
Other research interests include geoeconomics, the future Liberal International Order and illiberalism, and party politics.

My name is Unai Gómez-Hernández, and I am a researcher in European Union external action at the University of Edinburgh and KU Leuven, where I am completing a joint doctorate. My research focuses on EU foreign policy, geopolitics, and the external dimensions of European integration, with particular attention to EU–China relations, geoeconomics, and the role of political parties in shaping the EU’s global positioning. 

Alongside my doctoral research, I have teaching experience across politics, international relations, and public speaking. From 2022 to 2023, I taught seminars and tutorials at the University of Edinburgh in courses including Politics and International Relations: Concepts and Debates, Europe and International Migration, and Energy Policy and Politics. Prior to that, I also taught public speaking and debating at the University of the Basque Country Debating Society. In 2025, I delivered a workshop at the University of Edinburgh’s Centre for Data, Culture & Society on analysing polarisation in political texts using R. 

I have also been actively involved in academic life through research communities and networks. Since 2022, I have served as co-convenor of the Europa Postgraduate Research Group at the Europa Institute, contributing to the organisation of scholarly activities and intellectual exchange among postgraduate researchers. I am also engaged with the China in Europe Research Network (CHERN), a member of the UNA Europa Global Governance Research Group, and a founding member of the Spanish Political Science Association’s Standing Group on the European Union. 

Beyond academia, I have professional experience in EU institutions and policy-oriented environments. I worked as Assistant to the Delegate of the Basque Country to the European Union in Brussels and previously as an environmental policy monitoring officer at Aclima, the Basque Environmental Cluster. Earlier in my career, I conducted research on populist parties and the future of the EU at the University of the Basque Country. 

My research has been published in peer-reviewed journals such as European Security, Global Policy, and Europe-Asia Studies, as well as in edited volumes and policy-oriented outlets. I have also published policy papers with the Foundation of European Progressive Studies (FEPS), the Central European Institute of Asian Studies (CEIAS), and the Association for International Affairs (AMO). I regularly contribute to academic and policy debates through reports and expert commentary, and I participate in international conferences and research networks. 

I hold a joint PhD in European Union External Action (University of Edinburgh and KU Leuven), a Master of Arts in International Relations and Diplomacy of the European Union from the College of Europe, and bachelor’s degrees in International Relations (London School of Economics) and Political Science and Public Administration (University of the Basque Country). I work in Spanish, English, and French, and I use quantitative and computational methods, including R and text analysis, in my research.
